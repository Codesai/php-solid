# php-solid
Project with sample katas for practicing solid principles in php

## Single responsability principle

The idea of this kata is to understand the diferent responsabilities in the HtmlTextConverter class and propose some refactors to be more inline with the srp principle.

We can identify at least two responsabilities in this code:
* Manage files (open, read..)
* convert a text to html


## Credits

`HtmlTextConverter` kata is based on work by [Emily Bache](https://github.com/emilybache/Racing-Car-Katas/blob/main/php/src/TextConverter/HtmlTextConverter.php)
